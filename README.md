It is a task where I had to create some of the Api's.

## Technologies

Step 1: Run the command 'npm install' to install all the dependencies mentioned in the package.json file.

Step 2: Once the dependencies are installed, navigate to database/config.js file, and do database setup locally.

Step 3: Once DB setup is done, run the command 'npm run insert', it will push the required data to database. When its done, it will show success message 'Date Inserted'.

Step 4. Start your applicaton by running 'npm start'. It will start at the port.
